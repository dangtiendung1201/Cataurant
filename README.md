## Idea

From mini-game called Comfy Cakes in Purple Place ([Info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purble_Place "Infomation about the game"), [Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRxOvRQpPmg&pp=ygUXcHVyYmxlIHBsYWNlIHdpbmRvd3MgNyA%3D "Demo video")) included with Windows 7 operating systems, I create a new game with the same logic[^fn1]. Instead of a "conveyor belt" in the original game, I use a "deque" to manage "burger ingredients". "Requests" are shown as "customers", ... and many changes. Threfore, my game is just about 10% similar to the original game.

I chose this game because I want to challenge myself with a new game that requires a lot of thinking in design and implement. I also want to create a game that is not too simple and not too complicated, so that I can play it in my free time.

## Gameplay

### Objective

Your objective in this game is to serve your customers as quickly as possible, while also feeding hungry cat (bottom-left corner) if you want. You have 3 lives, so try to serve as many customers as possible without making mistakes.

### Ingredients

There are 4 types of ingredients in the game: `Bread`, `Meat`, `Tomato`, `Lettuce`.

### Seller

You are the seller (Doraemon) who will serve the customers. You can move left and right to serve customers. You can also control the deque of ingredients by using up and down arrow keys.

### Customers

At the start of the game, customers will begin to appear at your stall with their requests. Each customer has a patience bar, which will decrease if you take too long to serve them. If a customer's patience bar runs out, they will leave and you will lose a life.

### Hungry Cat

Hungry cat will appear at the bottom-left corner of the screen. You can feed him if you want. He may give you some bonuses randomly (play the game to find out them) after being feed.

### Score

You will get score for each customer you serve. You will also get score for each customer you feed. The score will be displayed at the top-left corner of the screen.

### Lives

Lives will be displayed at the top-right corner of the screen. You will lose when you run out of lives.

### Controls

- `Left, Right arrow keys` to move the seller (Doraemon).
- `Up, Down arrow keys` to control the deque of ingredients.
